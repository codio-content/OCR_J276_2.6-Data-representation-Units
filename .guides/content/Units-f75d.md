In this lesson we will look at why data needs to be converted into a binary format to be processed by a computer and the units used to measure the amount of data stored in memory or by storage devices.

All data needs to be converted into a binary format because of the way that computers work.

Inside the processor millions of calculations are performed each second when programs are running.

All of these calculations are performed by **transistors** working together in circuits. There are billions of transistors in a modern processor and they act as switches – they are either on or off. They have only two states – they either transmit an electric current or they do not. 
As there are only two states – off or on – they can be represented by two digits – 0 and 1.

All computer programs and data used by a computer have to be represented by millions of 1s and 0s.

That is why the binary system is used as it uses the digits 0 and 1 and all commands and data, from word processed documents to complex images can be represented using binary representation.
