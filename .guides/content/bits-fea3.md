Have a look at this website:

The two digits 1 and 0 are called **bits**. As a program or image may consist of millions or billions of bits, they are grouped into larger units.

1 **nibble** = 4 bits.

1 **byte** = 8 bits. This is $2^3$ bits.


**Each of the following units is now $2^{10}$ or 1024 times higher than the previous one.**

1 **kilobyte** = $2^{10}$ bytes = 1024 bytes.

1 **megabyte** = $2^{10}$ kilobytes or 220 bytes

1 **gigabyte** = $2^{10}$ megabytes = 230 bytes

1 **terabyte** = $2^{10}$ gigabytes = 240 bytes

1 **petabyte** = $2^{10}$terabytes = 250 bytes


Using the prefixes kilo, mega, giga, tera etc. has led to some confusion and controversy as they are official prefixes of the SI system and in all other applications each one is 1000 or 103 times higher than the previous one e.g. megahertz (MHz), as it uses the decimal system and not the binary system.

 These two methods of calculating these values are known as the **binary prefix** and the **decimal prefix**.

The differences can be shown in the following table:

To avoid confusion and ambiguity, in 1998 standards and trade organisations introduced a new set of binary prefixes – kibi, mebi, gibi, tebi etc.

As the United States [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology) has stipulated that the SI units must only be used in the decimal sense the following are perfectly acceptable and will be used in these lessons:

1 kilobyte = 1000 bytes
1 megabyte = 1000 kilobytes
1 gigabyte = 1000 megabytes
1 terabyte = 1000 gigabytes
1 petabyte = 1000 terabytes
